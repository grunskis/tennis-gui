# Requirements

To use tennis app you will need:

* Arduino board
* Two buttons with connected wires
* Some kind of PC with USB port, keyboard & monitor

My current setup shown here in [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/grunskis/tennis-controller)

# Controls

You can test Processing software even without connected Arduino board
with these keys:

* **LEFT**, **RIGHT** arrows select left and rigth side players name
* **a** & **b** to increase, **A** & **B** to decrease points for left or right player
* **r** reset score & players

Basically these are the same commands that Arduino sends to Processing when
it's connected.
